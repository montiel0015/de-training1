# Overview

This project is part of Wizeline's Data Engineering material. The goal of this
project is to provide a set of tools and information to practice several data
engineering solutions to common problems.

## Alimazon

The problems found in this documentation pertain a fictional e-commerce service
called Alimazon.

Before trying to solve Alimazon problems you should know that most of its data
belongs in any of three datasets.

  * [The clients dataset](specs/clients/)
  * [The stock dataset](specs/stock/)
  * [The buy-orders dataset](specs/orders/)

First get familiarized with the data models of the datasets; then move to the
[problems](problems/) section to help Alimazon on its quest to <del>World
domination</del> be the go-to online store for the World.
